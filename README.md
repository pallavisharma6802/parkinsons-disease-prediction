### Advanced Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Model

Developed a sophisticated Parkinson’s Disease prediction model using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**. Focused on **K-Nearest Neighbors** (KNN) to achieve superior performance with an **accuracy of 97.96%**. Enhanced the model through advanced feature engineering techniques such as **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** and **GridSearchCV** for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. This comprehensive approach ensured optimal model performance and reliable predictions. 

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, RFE, GridSearchCV.
